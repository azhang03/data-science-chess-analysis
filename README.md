# Data Science Chess Analysis
Answering numerous chess questions with data science procedures (clustering, ML, etc...)

### Want to duplicate the results?
You will need to generate your own API key from Lichess.com to scrape player-specific matches

**Currently done:** 
- Scraping ~6000 chess games from Lichess users (specifically users froom team 'coders')
- 3 Variable PCA
- K-means clustering on 3 variables
- (seemingly) unsuccessful PCA on 6 variables
- (seemingly) unsuccessful K-means clustering on 6 variables

**Todo:**
- Scraping of only Stockfish-analyzed Lichess matches
- Scraping centipawn info (for mistake and performance analysis based on elo)
- Training
