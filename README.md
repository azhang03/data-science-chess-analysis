Answering numerous chess questions with data science procedures (clustering, ML, etc...)

Currently done: 
- Scraping ~6000 chess games from Lichess users (specifically users froom team 'coders')
- 3 Variable PCA
- K-means clustering on 3 variables
- (seemingly) unsuccessful PCA on 6 variables
- (seemingly) unsuccessful K-means clustering on 6 variables

Todo:
- Scraping of only Stockfish-analyzed Lichess matches
- Scraping centipawn info (for mistake and performance analysis based on elo)
- Training
